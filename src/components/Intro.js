With online reservation software you can easily let members (or non-members) make reservations for tennis courts, squash courts or padel courts online at any time. You can refer to your online calendar with a link or you can simply integrate SuperSaaS on your website or Facebook page. Automatically send booking confirmations and reminders. And apply rules such as price rules to allow members to book for free and to have non-members pay upfront for renting a court.
